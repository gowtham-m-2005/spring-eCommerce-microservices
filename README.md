# E-Commerce Microservices with Docker & Spring Boot

A distributed **E-Commerce application** built using **Spring Boot 3**, **Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka**, and **Docker Compose**.
This project demonstrates real microservices architecture with separate services for **User**, **Product**, and **Cart** ‚Äî each running in isolated containers and communicating via **OpenFeign** through a **Service Registry**.

---

## üöÄ Technologies Used

* **Java 17**
* **Spring Boot 3**
* **Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka** for service discovery
* **Spring Data JPA** for database persistence
* **PostgreSQL** as the relational database (containerized)
* **OpenFeign** for inter-service communication
* **Docker & Docker Compose** for containerization and orchestration
* **Maven** as the build automation tool

## üß© Architecture Overview

This system currently consists of four microservices:

| Service              | Role                                                           |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **user-service**     | Manages user data and CRUD operations                          |
| **product-service**  | Handles product management, search, and updates                |
| **cart-service**     | Manages user carts and interactions between users and products |
| **service-registry** | Eureka server for service registration and discovery           |

### ‚öôÔ∏è Service Communication Flow

```
Client
   ‚Üì
User / Product / Cart Service
   ‚Üì (via Eureka)
Service Registry (Eureka)
   ‚Üì
PostgreSQL Databases (in Docker)
```

Each service is independently containerized and connected through a shared Docker network, allowing seamless communication and isolated scaling.

---

## Features Implemented

### User Service

* CRUD operations for user profiles
* Integration with PostgreSQL

### Product Service

* Create, update, delete, and search products
* REST API with JPA persistence
* Exposed via `/api/products`

### Cart Service

* Add items to user cart
* Validates user and product existence via Feign clients
* Exposed via `/api/cart`

### Service Registry

* Centralized Eureka server for all service discovery
* Enables dynamic lookup and communication

---

## üê≥ Docker Compose Setup

The project uses a single `docker-compose.yml` file to orchestrate all services:

```bash
# Build and start all containers in detached mode
docker compose up -d

# Stop and remove containers
docker compose down
```
